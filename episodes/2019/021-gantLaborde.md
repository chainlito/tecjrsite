This week we talk to Mad Scientist Gant Laborde about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning! Data Science! Yay buzzwords!

So what even _is_ machine learning? Do you need Math/Python to get into it? What sorts of problems can it solve?

We answer all those questions and more, plus dive into how you can get started with machine learning with your JavaScript skills. We talk about TensorflowJS, multi-dimensional arrays, and some other scary stuff, but we promise it's more approachable than you think!
