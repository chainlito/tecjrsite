LinkedIn and Indeed are a bit of a mystery.

You fill out your profile and fire off some applications, sit back, and wait.

But at the same time, other developers out there tell stories of how recruiters won't leave them alone. How come those other people get all this attention, but you can't get eyeballs on your resume or profile?

Vincent Tang has some answers. While looking for a job recently as a junior developer, Vincent was able to optimize his Indeed and LinkedIn profiles so that he was getting calls from Google and Amazon to apply, even though he has 0 industry experience!

The best part? Vincent's methods are easy enough that you can do the same thing and get the same results.

We also talk about anime at the end. Hey, gotta have Nerd Minute.
