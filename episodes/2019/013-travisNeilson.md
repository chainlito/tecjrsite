Listen. I'm a developer, and design makes me... *nervous*.

It's a very touchy-feely, amorphous, subjective thing that has no clear right or wrong. With code, things work or they don't. With a design, some people ðŸ’– it, some ***hate*** it.

How do you navigate that?

[**Travis Neilson**](http://travisneilson.com/) to the rescue! Travis is a Google Search Designer, podcaster, YouTuber, and developer with a lot of experience.

We talk about what UX/UI even is and means, how to get started with design, and why Tobey Maguire is the best Spiderman. (Yes. And you know what, it was somewhat relevant to design)

This was a long episode, but there wasn't much fat to trim. A lot of critical thinking goes into a product and service for a customer, and we talk about all the different angles you can come at solving problems for users.

It's not just about where you place the buttons and what colors you use.
