[Will Johnson](https://twitter.com/willjohnsonio) has a very interesting and inspiring story to share.

Will originally reached out to us through Twitter and asked to be on the show. We thought, sure why not, and started to dig into something to talk about.

We learned that Will is a father of 6, and codes between 12-hour shifts at a powder factory. He also knows how to leverage social media to help others and build his brand. And then if that isn't enough, he also helps out at the [Kansas City Coder's Dojo](http://coderdojokc.com/) where he shares his love of coding with kids through MIT's [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).

I think the most important thing we learned from speaking with Will was to stay motivated and positive on our own journey.  I hope you are as inspired by Will as we are.
