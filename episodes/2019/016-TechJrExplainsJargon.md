I remember back to when I was learning programming for the first time. I thought every variable should be `x`, `y`, or `z`, tried to do everything without functions, and the concept of recursion melted my face off. (Honestly merge sort still melts my face off ðŸ¤¯)

So for this episode we tried to explain all the concepts we could think of starting off with variables and work our way up in complexity. We don't nail each thing 100% but I think we did OK!
