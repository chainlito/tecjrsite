## Ooh, new side project... lemme get coding!

I'm sure we've all been there. We get an idea, start coding a proof of concept, and then our POC becomes production... but wait, what does it need to do again?

## Pump the brakes and consider your users

Marisa Morby knows all about this process. Marisa worked as a Product Manager for Gatsby, meaning she was ultimately responsible for nailing down the end goal of the project and making sure all teams kept their eye on the prize while building it out.

In this episode we learn what a Product Manager is (they rock, go work at a company that employs one), and Marisa also tells us how to apply her PM knowledge to our own projects. We talk about designing for the user, and prototyping our app so we have clear direction _before_ coding.

We also dig into writing a ðŸ”¥ conference proposal, getting over a fear of public speaking, and then dive into Nerd Minute and explore Discworld!

**Note:** Lee will be speaking at DevFest Florida on Nov 16th, come see his talk and meet Lee and Eddie in person! - [DevFest Site](https://devfestflorida.org/)
