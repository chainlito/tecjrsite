Freelancing is in the back of a lot of developers' minds when they get started in the industry. They have thoughts like:

_"I can be my own boss... Make my own hours... I could even work from the beach."_

Sound familiar? We've also had those daydreams more than a few times.

However, there's a lot more to freelancing than sipping Mai Tais and writing a little bit of HTML.

How do you get clients? How do you keep said clients from driving you crazy? What should you charge for a website? Do you  need a contract?

The unknown can start to snowball and most people think, _Well, maybe I'll freelance later._ And later never comes.

Roy Jossfolk has taken all those lumps already in his 14 years as a freelance developer. He came on the show to tell us how junior devs can get into freelancing, how to identify good clients, and how to avoid bad ones. Most of all, he talks about how to safeguard your time and energy as a freelancer so you can be successful and avoid burnout.
