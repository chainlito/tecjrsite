Chris Biscardi is a consultant with a lot of experience building cool stuff we love to use: MDX, Docker, Gatsby...

We talk to Chris about his career so far and lessons learned, as well as dive into some juicy details on how some of our favorite frameworks work under the hood.

Plus... Gatsby themes! Themes are more useful than just reusable UI like a Wordpress theme, they're a more sane way to package and maintain configurations and dependencies in Gatsby.

Ever updated a Gatsby starter? ðŸ˜±

Themes make that process better. ðŸ˜Ž

Chris is also passionate about improving the tech industry and doing better by junior devs as a whole. We couldn't resist diving into the junior dev dilemma for a minute on this episode.

Chris also loves Rocket League, and we talk about that too!
