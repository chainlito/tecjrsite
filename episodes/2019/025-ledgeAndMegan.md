excerpt: "Do the terms \"Passion\" and \"Culture Fit\" make you confused and slightly annoyed when you ask what an employer is looking for in a new hire? We dig into what those things mean and what hiring managers really want in a candidate. Then, Ledge and Megan tell us how to convey those things through our resumes and Linkedin profiles."

## "What are you looking for in a developer?"

I ask this question every time I talk to a recruiter or really anyone from a company that's looking to hire.

I _almost always_ get **"passion"** and **"culture fit"** for an answer.

But what the heck do those terms even mean? Passion for what? What "culture" do we need to fit into?

[David Ledgerwood](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidledgerwood/) and [Megan Fister](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meganfister/) really cut through the fluff on this topic. Ledge started asking CTO's what they want in developers, and refused to take "passion" and "culture fit" as answers. The results will surprise you.

Ledge and Megan both also have a ton of experience matching up companies and developers. They've read hundreds, if not thousands of resumes, and so I asked them to review our post-bootcamp resumes and Linkedin profiles! We received some great feedback and practical advice on how to improve our job search materials.

If you're searching for a developer job, this episode is a __must listen__!
