Detroit Labs developer Aisha Blake joins us on the show this week!

Aisha attends and speaks at a lot of conferences as a junior developer. Out of 20 conferences she attended last year, she spoke at FOURTEEN (14!) of them!

We ask Aisha about her secret sauce for speaking at conferences as well as how to overcome any doubts about being "too junior" to give a talk.

We also dig into a little of tech's diversity problem and try to describe the challenge we all face. We talk about dealing with deniers, racism, and also some wins Aisha has seen through her own community involvement.
