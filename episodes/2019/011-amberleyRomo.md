What the heck is [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org)? A React Framework? A static-site generator?

OK, but, what is _that_?

[Amberley Romo](https://twitter.com/amber1ey) joins us to break down the complexity and explain why you should give Gatsby a shot!

Amberley also tells us her story of getting into development and how she came to work on the Gatsby team. We dive into why learning Gatsby is so great and also how powerful the platform is for making performant and optimized sites.

We also touch on Tech's diversity problem and why we need to do better by Junior Developers as an industry.

PS: Amberley has her own podcast now called Fullstack Health!
