## Testing software is a complex and often-neglected aspect of development.

How many tutorials have you watched that demo a framework/cli/library that generates a `.test` file, only for the tutorial author to politely ask you to ignore that `.test` file?

I get it. Testing is confusing, and it's a huge derail when you're trying to learn to code. However, testing is important!

Not only is it a valuable skill to tout on your resume or in an interview, but it's a great learning tool as well!

When you write tests, you're double-checking yourself in the future when you make changes to your code. You're making a contract that says, _"I state that this software should behave like this."_ If you change something and all of a sudden half of your tests fail, you may discover things you didn't realize about how you coded your software.

Also, when you're _writing_ your tests, you may realize what kind of pandora's box you've opened coding that new feature!
