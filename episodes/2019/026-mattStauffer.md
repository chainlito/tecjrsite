## WAMP, MAMP, XAMPP... more like CRAMP!

Eddie and Lee are JavaScript developers that are spoiled by that ecosystem. Coming from code boot camps, neither one had a great experience when it came to PHP.

For Lee, he couldn't figure out how to install PHP and make it play nice with his Windows machine. When he opened Laravel, it was a jungle of files and folders.

Eddie's class skipped PHP entirely in favor of spending more time on React.

But they haven't forgotten about PHP! Lots of companies use PHP/Laravel for their API/back end stack, freelancers love PHP because it's cheap and easy to deploy, and seemingly _every_ CMS is built on PHP.

After feeling left out for so long, Lee and Eddie found Matt Stauffer and asked, "Why is getting into PHP so tough?"

This episode is all about the best ways to get into PHP and Laravel and start learning and being productive. Matt was a fantastic and knowledgeable guest, and he shared a fantastic game plan for beginning your PHP journey.
