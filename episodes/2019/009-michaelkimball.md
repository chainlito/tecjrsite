When I was a fresh-faced college student, I decided I was going to become a computer scientist. I took my first intro to CS course and had my hopes and dreams dashed almost immediately. I printed triangles to the terminal and coded in notepad for a whole year, folks.

Ten years after that course I eventually made my way back to programming, but I haven't touched Java since.

However, Java is an enterprise darling and I think it deserves another shot. Plus there's so much you can do with it, like build Desktop programs, Web Servers, and make Android apps!

That's why we invited Michael Kimball, [The Code Operative](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMm7l6iBe5ShFkp6yTWnV6A), to come and set us straight on how to get going with Java.

Michael works as a backend developer writing Java apps and cares about teaching new devs how to learn Java while guiding them through the complicated Oracle landscape.
