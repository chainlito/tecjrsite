We got Scott Tolinski on the show!

For the uninitiated, Scott is one half of the [Syntax](https://syntax.fm) podcast and runs his own course platform at [Level Up Tutorials](https://leveluptutorials.com).

Scott agreed to come on the show and answer all our questions about web development, kung-fu movies, breakdancing, and a few other things. We were a little nervous having someone like Scott for our first interview episode, but it turned out pretty well I think!
