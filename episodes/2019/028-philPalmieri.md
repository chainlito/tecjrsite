If you're anything like us, you've probably made an express server, talked to a front-end app and maybe even a database, and possibly deployed your server to something like heroku.

You see jobs pop up for "Node Engineer", hear recruiters say that "NodeJS jobs are so hot right now", and you start to wonder...

## What does it take to get a job working with Node?

Phil Palmieri to the rescue!

Phil is a Node engineer working for [Oddball.io](https://oddball.io), and he knows a lot about Node. Phil walks us through testing, cloud services, databases, and deployment of Node services and microservices, so by the end of this episode you should have a great idea of what you need to work on to improve your Node skills!
