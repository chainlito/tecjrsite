## Working with AWS is Tough!

I have a friend that describes AWS dashboards as "DevOps Porn".

You don't have to be a DevOps wizard to try AWS though! AWS Amplify is an accelerator for AWS that will get you up and running quickly.

Today Kurt runs us through the use cases for Amplify as well ask talks about using it as a starting point for AWS.

In the second half of the show, we dive into some career advice for developers that are working to overcome their past.

### We've had more than a few developers reach out to us about felony convictions and background checks.

Kurt knows quite a bit about the topic. Kurt is an ex-convict and managed to get into Tech despite having felony charges. We dive into Kurt's story and how he turned his life around after spending most of his 20's behind bars.
