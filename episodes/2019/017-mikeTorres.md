I haven't had great luck with recruiters. Neither has Eddie.

When we were brand-new, we emailed and handed out resumes to a bunch of recruiters and never heard from them again.

So we were pretty sour on them right off-the-bat.

Six months into our careers, our linkedin's started blowing up with low-effort recruiter spam advertising Java positions. (We know Java*Script* ðŸ™„)

When a recruiter wanted to come on the show, my first thought was, _"Oh boy. What's this guy selling?"_

Turns out Mike Torres wants to be a developer himself. He wants to share his experience so he can help out the community. Check out what he has to say on this week's episode!
